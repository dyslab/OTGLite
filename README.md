### Important notes:

In case you want to install, rebuild or run this application on another computer, you are supposed to use `nvm` to maintain a suitable node.js version to install, rebuild or run it.  On my case, I am failed to rebuild the application on node.js v21 framework, and I rebuild it and run the web service successfully when I use `nvm` to change to node.js v14 framework though.

A good idea is to use an older version node.js (such as v14, v13, v12...)  to use this kind of elder applications. Too many changes have occured on newer version of node.js, that makes it doesn't fit for these 'elders'. üòâ 

`nvm`: Node Version Manager. check it out on [https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
