### Important notes:

In case you want to install or rebuild this application on another computer, you are supposed to use `nvm` to maintain a suitable node.js version to rebuild it.  On my case, I am failed to rebuild the application on node.js v21 framework, and I rebuild it successfully when I use `nvm` to change to node.js v14 framework though.

A good idea is to use a older version node.js (v14, v13, v12...)  to install or rebuild this elder application. Too many changes have occured on newer version of node.js, that makes it doesn't fit for the elder application. üòâ 

`nvm`: Node Version Manager. check it out on [https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
